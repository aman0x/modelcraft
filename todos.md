Phase 1: Research and Planning
    Research existing tools for converting floorplans to 3D models.
    Select image processing libraries (OpenCV, PIL) and 3D libraries (Open3D, Three.js, Babylon.js).
    Define core features of the tool (image upload, 2D to 3D conversion, export options, UI).

Phase 2: Image Preprocessing and Layout Analysis
    Implement image upload functionality (png/jpg).
    Preprocess the uploaded image (grayscale conversion, edge detection, contour detection).
    Extract walls, doors, and windows using contour analysis.

Phase 3: AI/ML-Based Object Detection
    Collect and label a dataset of floorplans (walls, doors, windows).
    Train an object detection model (YOLOv8, custom CNN) for floorplan component detection.
    Integrate the trained model to identify components in new floorplan images.

Phase 4: 3D Model Generation
    Extract 2D data from the floorplan (wall positions, door/window locations).
    Implement logic to extrude walls and generate 3D components.
    Implement logic to add floors, ceilings, and other structures in 3D.
    Allow basic customization (scale, position, rotation) of 3D objects.

Phase 5: Model Exporting and UI Development
    Implement export functionality (GLB, OBJ).
    Build a user interface for image upload and 3D model display.
    Integrate a 3D viewer (Three.js or Babylon.js) to visualize the generated model.
    Add interactivity in the 3D viewer (zoom, rotate, modify materials).

Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
    Test the tool with various floorplan images.
    Optimize the 3D rendering process for performance.
    Test AI model for detection accuracy and speed.


Phase 7: Finalization and Deployment
    Finalize the UI/UX for a smooth user experience.
    Deploy the tool on a server or as a web application.
    Create documentation for usage and API.
    Regularly update and maintain the tool (AI model, features).
